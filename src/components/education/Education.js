                                Architecture. Here I have gained a strong
                                foundation in computing, <br />
                                mathematical theory of computing, and different
                                programming pardigms. I learned the core
                                fundamentals of algorithms, data structures, and
                                problem solving with the C and <br />

                                In the Spring of 2020, I took a competitive
                                programming course that allowed me to practice
                                and improve on my problem-solving skills, <br />{" "}
                                algorithms, and data structures. This course put
                                me in a competitive environment with individual,
                                team, and online contests. Online contests{" "}

                                were used frequently to prepare for the in-class
                                contests, such as CodeForces, Google Code Jam,
                                Kattis, and UCF's programming team practice
                                contests.

                                and Erlang. I am also starting to learn Data
                                Science to continue on to one of <br />
                                my favorite topics, Machine Learning.
