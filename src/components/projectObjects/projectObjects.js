			'This website simulates a basic chat room that any user can use. If a user would like to send a message, then he or she can write their username and a message to post. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop the front-end without using any frameworks. I also developed an Express.JS REST API to funnel all messages and its data to a MongoDB database. I used Mongo Atlas to host the database. The main goal for me is to practice and learn how to develop a full-stack web application from scratch.',
